When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with other people or when you want to work in different computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you can decide whether it’s the time to pull the changes or you want to add some more features to the repository.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies inside GitHub, clones are copies from GitHub to your computer and branches are copies in your computer.
I would use clones when I want to work on an existing project locally in my computer and then upload it when I finish.
I would use branches when I want to test experimental features or fix bugs in my computer for sharing them after.
I would use fork when I want to work on someone's repository whitout modifying the original one.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can view it offline.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It all would be harder.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
I'd want to make changes in a separate branch when I'm trying out a new feature or I'm fixing bugs. 
It let you work without the fear of deleting something essential for the project.
