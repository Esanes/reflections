How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?

    
The comparison of the content helped me finding the bug.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
 efficient programmer in the long term?

  
You wouldn't lose so much time looking for the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


You can decide which versions to save, you can make an error and forget to save a version.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
You can save different versions easily.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 
Typing them in the Git Bash.
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

You avoid deleting something important and you can have a backup.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
I haven't been able to set my workspace yet.
